## 💭 Abstract
"Rancid Tomatillos" is a web application designed to provide users with a comprehensive movie exploration experience, similar to popular platforms like Rotten Tomatoes. The application allows users to browse through a curated collection of movies, view detailed information about each movie, watch trailers or clips, and access reviews to make informed decisions about their movie choices.

## 📝  Context
We are a pair of 2 front-end developers who worked together remotely via Zoom and asynchronously through the GitHub project board to complete this application. This project was completed from week 1 to week 3 in Mod 3 of the Front End development program at Turing School of Software & Design.

## 🔌 Server Setup
1. Clone the repository: Open a terminal window. Navigate to the directory where you want to clone the repository. Run the following command: git clone git@github.com:em2396/rancid-tomatillos.git
2. Install the dependencies: Run the following command in the cloned repository directory: npm install
3. Run the React app: Run the following command in the cloned repository directory: npm start
4. Open the app in your web browser by navigating to http://localhost:3000

## 📚 Learning Goals
- Gain competency with React fundamentals
- Test React components & asynchronous JS
- Practice refactoring
- Create a multi-page UX using Router

## 🥇 Wins
⭐ Successfully using React for the first time while including refactoring for router
⭐ Working collaboratively as a team to overcome any obstacles and combining our knowledge to create a successful app
⭐ Successfully implement cypress testing


## 🚧 Challenges
❗ Using Cypress for the first time was challenging and difficult to wrap our heads around the syntax compared to previously using mocha and chai.
❗ At first, the CSS was challenging and the responsive design was being difficult because of our code. We got it working through using an event listener.
