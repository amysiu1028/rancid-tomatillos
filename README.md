## 💭 Abstract
"Rancid Tomatillos" is a web application designed to provide users with a comprehensive movie exploration experience, similar to popular platforms like Rotten Tomatoes. The application allows users to browse through a curated collection of movies, view detailed information about each movie, watch trailers or clips, and access reviews to make informed decisions about their movie choices.

## 📝  Context
We are a pair of 2 front-end developers who worked together remotely via Zoom and asynchronously through the GitHub project board to complete this application. This project was completed from week 1 to week 3 in Mod 3 of the Front End development program at Turing School of Software & Design.
